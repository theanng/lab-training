# Lab Training

## Introduction:
Training phases of Machine Learning lab in BKAI, HUST 2023. The training procedure consists of three phases:
  - Phase 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
    - Session 1: Ridge Regression, text preprocessing: Bag of words, TF-IDF, Words2vec
    - Session 2: K-Means, Support vector machine
    - Session 3: ANN 
    - Session 4: Time-series data, RNN, LSTM
    
  - Phase 2: Probabilistic Graphical Model
